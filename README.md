# Hello Brewster!

Hello Brewster is an application for craft beer enthusiasts. You can check in and out of breweries and also see whoâ€™s there.

## Installation

You can find it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-brewster/id1574235179) in the app store to install.

## About
- This app is written is SwiftUI so only devices using iOS 13+ will be compatible
- It utilizes MapKit, CloudKit, CoreLocation, SwiftUI to achieve the desired end product
- I've personally curated data hosted on iCloud. More locations will be added soon. Recommendations are always welcome.
- It's deployed to the App Store with a premium version as non-consumable in-app purchase. I will probably remove this and look into running ads instead.
- More optimizations will be integrated soon
